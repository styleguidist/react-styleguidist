## How to debug my components and examples?

1. Open your browser’s developer tools
2. Write `debugger;` statement wherever you want: in a component source, a Markdown example or even in an editor in a browser.

## How to debug the exceptions thrown from my components?

1. Put `debugger;` statement at the beginning of your code.
2. Press the ![Debugger](http://wow.sapegin.me/image/2n2z0b0l320m/debugger.png) button in your browser’s developer tools.
3. Press the ![Continue](http://wow.sapegin.me/image/2d2z1Y2o1z1m/continue.png) button and the debugger will stop execution at the next exception.

## Why does the style guide list one of my prop types as `unknown`?

This occurs when you are assigning props via `getDefaultProps` that are not listed within the components `propTypes`.

For example, the color prop here is assigned via `getDefaultProps` but missing from the `propTypes`, therefore the style guide is unable to display the correct prop type.

```javascript
Button.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['small', 'normal', 'large'])
};

Button.defaultProps = {
  color: '#333',
  size: 'normal'
};
```
