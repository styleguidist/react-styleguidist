# Getting Started with React Styleguidist

## 1. Install Styleguidist

Install webpack if you don’t have it already and aren't using Create React App:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Install Styleguidist:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-styleguidist
```

## 2. Configure your style guide

**If you’re using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) you can skip this step.**

[Point Styleguidist to your React components](Components.md) and [tell it how to load your code](Webpack.md).

## 3. Start your style guide

Run **`npx styleguidist server`** to start a style guide dev server.

Run **`npx styleguidist build`** to build a static version.

## 4. Start documenting your components

See how to [document your components](Documenting.md)
